The gas optimizooooors have launched their latest psyop in the form of a PR stunt. They deposited 100 ETH into a contract, where the first person to solve the challenge receives the full amount. Obviously, they don't want anyone to actually win this sum, so they implemented clever protections against winning the highest possible amount.

### WINNING CONDITION
