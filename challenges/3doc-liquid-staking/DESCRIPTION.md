Everybody's buzzing of a new invite-only project, where you get the one-time-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stake ETH and swap it for a real ERC-20!!!

You liked and re-posted on X a gazillion times to finally get a "free" code; then holding your breath rushed to the fancy UI that wraps their publicly-available contracts. 

But wait, I am sure none of the fine-prints ever said that there is a 10% entry fee...

### WINNING CONDITION
