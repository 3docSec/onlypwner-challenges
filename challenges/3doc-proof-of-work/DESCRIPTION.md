A friend told you about this weird DAO, folks raving all the time about vampires and darkness. They even created a DRK ðŸ’©token. In one of their latest deliriums, they ended up claiming to have invented the concept of proof of work...

While randomly browsing their activity on a block explorer, you noticed this strange contract: it's an open challenge. In your face, just like that. They sure have a hand for naming things.

### WINNING CONDITION

Steal at least half of the supply of DRK tokens.
